        My name is Gregory Hollenbeck and I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at Grand Canyon University (GCU). In the year 2010, I graduated from Mt.San Jacinto College with three associate degrees
    in Math & Science, Social/Behavioral Sciences, and Humanities.

    in Biblical Studies.</li>
    <li>After the years I attended Biola University, I was employed at Integrated Resources Institute (IRI) as a employment coach for people with developmental and intellectual 
    disabilities from the years 2015-2016.</li>
    <li>After my employment at IRI, I attended a Master's program in rofession Clinical Counseling at Brandman University (now known as UMass Global), only to 
    find that a profession in counseling was not the type of job I was looking for.</li>
    <li>Even though I decided not to enter counseling as a profession anymore, I still finished my Master's degree in 
    in the year 2019.</li>
    <li>Since the year 2019, I attended Grand Canyon University doctoral program in General Psychology with an emphasis in cognition and instruction. During the first two years as a doctoral

    </p>

    <p>As of recently, I pursued an interest in coding and learning programming languages. I'm currently learning R, Python, JavaScript, HTML, and I'm planning on learning CSS. This website will be a result of trying to put my coding skills to the test.
    Have fun and I hope what you find in this website to be interesting.</p>
